# Dakia is an API Gateway thatâ€™s Fully Programmable, Configurable, and Extensible!

**Dakia** is a powerful and flexible API Gateway designed for modern web applications.

## Features

> Work is in-progress

- **Fully Programmable**: Tailor the API Gateway to your specific needs with custom plugins and middleware in multiple languages.
- **Configurable**: Easily manage API configurations using various formats like YAML, JSON, and HTTP API calls.
- **Extensible**: Add new functionality with support for custom middleware and plugins, written in any programming language (Rust, Java, C++, etc.).
- **Zero Downtime Upgrades**: Perform upgrades and restarts without affecting the availability of your services.
- **Dynamic Middleware**: Add, remove, or modify middleware on the fly without disrupting service.
- **Request and Response Management**: Modify requests before they reach the upstream or read/write responses to meet your application's needs.
- **High-Performance**: Built on top of pingora which is battle-tested service with high traffic loads, serving more than **40** millions of requests per second.
- **Real-Time Configuration**: Modify your gateway configuration in real time with no downtime, using HTTP API calls.

Dakia ensures your services stay performant, reliable, and highly customizable, giving you full control.
